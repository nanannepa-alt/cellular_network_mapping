# Methodology: Cellular Network Performance Mapping

# Data Collection
- Tool Used: Network Cell Info Pro (Android app)  
- Metrics Captured:  
  - Latitude & Longitude (GPS coordinates)  
  - RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) → main signal strength metric for LTE/5G  
  - NetworkType (LTE, 5G, UMTS, CDMA)  
  - CellID (unique tower identifier)  
  - PCI (Physical Cell ID) → identifies individual LTE/5G cells  
  - TAC (Tracking Area Code) → groups cells for mobility management  
  - PSC (Primary Scrambling Code, UMTS)  
  - SID (System ID, CDMA)  
- Process:  
  - Logged data while moving through target areas (walking/driving).  
  - Exported raw CSV logs from the app.  


# Data Cleaning with coding
- Removed duplicate rows and incomplete entries.  
- Standardized column names (`Latitude`, `Longitude`, `RSRP`, `NetworkType`, `CellID`, `PCI`, `TAC`, `PSC`, `SID`).  
- Converted coordinates to decimal degrees for mapping.  
- Verified spatial concentration (limited movement during logging → clusters of points).  
- Saved cleaned dataset as `combined_cleaned_network_data.csv` in `data/processed/`.


# Visualization Workflow

#Folium (Python)
- Script: `scripts/Heatmap.py`  
- Generates `signal_strength_heatmap.html` with:  
  - Heatmap weighted by RSRP.  
  - Red markers for dead zones (RSRP < -110 dBm).  
  - Popups showing CellID and PCI.  
- Prints analysis summaries:  
  - Dead zone count.  
  - Average RSRP per CellID.  
  - LTE vs 5G comparison.

# Kepler.gl
- Upload `combined_cleaned_network_data.csv` to [Kepler.gl demo](https://kepler.gl/demo).  
- Import `configs/kepler_config.json` to load saved setup.  
- Layers configured:  
  - Point Layer → Radius by RSRP, Color by NetworkType, Tooltip with RSRP/CellID/PCI/TAC.  
  - Heatmap Layer → Weighted by RSRP, Radius tuned for smooth coverage, Color scale (Red → Green).  
- Filters:  
  - NetworkType toggle (LTE vs 5G).  
  - CellID isolation.  
  - PCI exploration for handoffs.  
- Exported as `kepler_map.html` (interactive) and `kepler_config.json` (reusable config).


# Analysis Approach
- Dead Zones: Defined as RSRP < -110 dBm. Exported to `dead_zones.csv`.  
- Tower Performance: Calculated average RSRP per CellID.  
- Network Comparison: Compared LTE vs 5G signal strength distributions.  
- Handoff Tracking: Observed PCI changes along route to identify tower transitions.


# Deliverables
- `visualizations/signal_strength_heatmap.html` → Folium map with analysis.  
- `visualizations/kepler_map.html` → Kepler interactive map.  
- `configs/kepler_config.json` → Saved Kepler setup.  
- `docs/screenshots/` → LTE vs 5G coverage previews.  
- `docs/methodology.md` → This documentation.


# Notes
- RSRP is the primary metric used (RSSI/RSRQ not available in dataset).  
- PSC, TAC, PCI, SID included for tower identification and mobility analysis.  
- GitHub Pages hosts the Kepler map for public access.
