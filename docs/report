# Cellular Network Performance Report

# Overview
This report summarizes the findings from the cellular network performance mapping project.  
Data was collected using Network Cell Info Pro, cleaned using python for consistency, and visualized using Folium and Kepler.gl.  
The goal was to identify coverage trends, dead zones, and handoffs across LTE and 5G networks.


# Key Findings

# 1. Coverage Trends
- **LTE** provided broader coverage with moderate signal strength (average RSRP between -95 and -105 dBm).  
- **5G** showed stronger signals in localized areas (average RSRP > -90 dBm) but limited geographic reach.  
- Coverage clusters aligned with tower locations, visible through CellID and PCI segmentation.

### 2. Dead Zones
- Defined as **RSRP < -110 dBm**.  
- Several dead zones were identified, particularly at route edges and areas with obstructed line-of-sight.  
- Dead zones were exported to `dead_zones.csv` and visualized as red points in Folium and Kepler maps.

### 3. Handoffs
- Observed through **PCI changes** along the route.  
- Smooth transitions occurred between LTE cells, while 5G handoffs were less frequent due to limited coverage.  
- Tracking Area Code (TAC) changes confirmed mobility management across regions.

### 4. Network Behavior
- **LTE**: Stable coverage, frequent handoffs between cells.  
- **5G**: Stronger localized signals, fewer handoffs, coverage gaps between towers.  
- **UMTS/CDMA identifiers (PSC, SID)** appeared in limited samples, reflecting legacy network presence.


# Limitations
- Dataset collected along a single route → limited geographic scope.  
- Movement during logging was constrained, leading to spatial clustering.  
- Metrics like **RSSI** and **RSRQ** were not available, restricting deeper quality analysis.  
- Environmental factors (buildings, terrain) not explicitly modeled.


# Conclusions
- RSRP alone is sufficient to highlight coverage strength and dead zones.  
- PCI and TAC provide valuable insights into tower-level behavior and mobility.  
- LTE remains dominant for coverage, while 5G offers stronger localized performance but with gaps.  
- Interactive maps (Folium + Kepler.gl) successfully visualize trends and enable filter-based exploration.
